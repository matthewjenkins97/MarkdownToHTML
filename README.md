# MarkdownToHTML

A simple Markdown to HTML converter written in Python 3. This was done as a pet project. I'm curious about the compilation process, although I am unable to take any material in the field at my college, so I decided to do this by myself to see if I could implement this without help. I succeeded.

## Usage

    markdowntohtml.py file.md

In order for this to work, "file.md" must be a markdown file, and must exist on the drive. The program also assumes that Python3 is on your computer.

## Preferred Syntax for markdowntohtml.py

### Italics

\*italics\*

### Bold

\*\*bold\*\*

### Text

\[text for link\]\(link\)

### Unordered Lists

\* unordered lists

### Quoted text

### Strikethrough text

### Line Break

### Headers

\#\#\# - Header 3

\#\#\#\# - Header 4

### Possible Improvements for later versions
